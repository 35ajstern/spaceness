This repository contains code for the paper 
"Space is the Place: Effects of Continuous Spatial Structure on Analysis of Population Genetic Data"
(preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/659235). Please cite the preprint if you find this code useful. 

The main SLiM simulation can be found in slim_recipes/spaceness.slim. Grid simulations in msprime are in scripts/run_msp_grid.py. Some useful tools for sampling and analyzing data from spatial slim simulations are in scripts/slimtools.py, but since the field of tree sequence analysis has moved so fast these are mostly out of date already(!).
