  abstract = {Spatial patterns in biological populations and the effect of spatial patterns on ecological interactions are central topics in mathematical ecology. Various approaches to modeling have been developed to enable us to understand spatial patterns ranging from plant distributions to plankton aggregation. We present a new approach to modeling spatial interactions by deriving approximations for the time evolution of the moments (mean and spatial covariance) of ensembles of distributions of organisms; the analysis is made possible by “moment closure,” neglecting higher-order spatial structure in the population. We use the growth and competition of plants in an explicitly spatial environment as a starting point for exploring the properties of second-order moment equations and comparing them to realizations of spatial stochastic models. We find that for a wide range of effective neighborhood sizes (each plant interacting with several to dozens of neighbors), the mean-covariance model provides a useful and analytically tractable approximation to the stochastic spatial model, and combines useful features of stochastic models and traditional reaction-diffusion-like models.},

@article{champer2019suppression,
  abstract = {Rapid evolutionary processes can produce drastically different outcomes when studied in panmictic population models versus spatial models where the rate of evolution is limited by dispersal. One such process is gene drive, which allows {\textquotedblleft}selfish{\textquotedblright} genetic elements to quickly spread through a population. Engineered gene drive systems are being considered as a means for suppressing disease vector populations or invasive species. While laboratory experiments and modeling in panmictic populations have shown that such drives can rapidly eliminate a population, it is not yet clear how well these results translate to natural environments where individuals inhabit a continuous landscape. Using spatially explicit simulations, we show that instead of population elimination, release of a suppression drive can result in what we term {\textquotedblleft}chasing{\textquotedblright} dynamics. This describes a condition in which wild-type individuals quickly recolonize areas where the drive has locally eliminated the population. Despite the drive subsequently chasing the wild-type allele into these newly re-colonized areas, complete population suppression often fails or is substantially delayed. This delay increases the likelihood that the drive becomes lost or that resistance evolves. We systematically analyze how chasing dynamics are influenced by the type of drive, its efficiency, fitness costs, as well as ecological and demographic factors such as the maximal growth rate of the population, the migration rate, and the level of inbreeding. We find that chasing is generally more common for lower efficiency drives and in populations with low dispersal. However, we further find that some drive mechanisms are substantially more prone to chasing behavior than others. Our results demonstrate that the population dynamics of suppression gene drives are determined by a complex interplay of genetic and ecological factors, highlighting the need for realistic spatial modeling to predict the outcome of drive releases in natural populations.},

@article{antonovics1980ecological,
  abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms of population size regulation is of vital
importance to both the pure and applied ecologist. Throughout the history
of ecology one school of thought has maintained that populations of plants
and animals are in some way regulated by "density-dependent factors"­
i.e. processes that either increase mortality or decrease fecundity as the
density of the population increases (133). Thus there would be a density­
dependent feedback that holds the population within certain limits. A sec­
ond school of thought has maintained that "density-independent factors"
(e.g. weather conditions or disturbance) are more important in determining
population size.
Whether populations are regulated by density-dependent or density­
independent factors has been the subject ofintensive debate and controversy
over the past twenty-five years, especially in the zoological literature ( l0,4 1 , 146). In part, the basis for this controversy may lie in different spatial
and temporal scales of reference, as well as in differing expectations about
the presence of equilibrium vs nonequilibrium states in natural populations
(37). Yet much of the controversy stems from a lack of adequate informa­
tion about density-dependent regulation, particularly with regard to its
frequency of occurrence, intensity, spatial pattern, and interactions with
density-independent factors. Technical problems in censusing populations,
particularly those of animals, and in studying the operation of the phenome­
non itself contribute to the paucity of information. Paradoxically, density­
dependent factors may operate during seasons when population numbers
are low, as when the regulating force is the number of refuges or "safe-sites"
available to tide the population over the harsh season. The operation of
density-dependent factors may be sporadic, will interact with density­
independent factors, or (in populations undergoing unpredictable fluctua­
tions in time and space) may only be one component necessary for the
continuing long-term persistence of those populations (37). Indeed, such
fluctuating populations have been cited as paradigms of density-independ­
ent regulation (e.g. 9).
The tractability of plants for population studies contrasts markedly with
that of animals. As a consequence, future understanding of the nature of
density-dependent regulation, and of its mode of operation with regard to
predictability, spatial and temporal scale of action, severity, and biological
basis, is likely to come from studies on plants. A clearer understanding of
the ecological, genetic, and evolutionary consequences of different kinds of
density dependence is also likely to be forthcoming.
This review describes the manifold causes and consequences of density­
dependent regulation, formulates new conceptual frameworks for their
study, and offers a predictive synthesis of ecological genetics as related to
plant density. This synthesis will, we hope, stimulate further research on the
process of density regulation. We review density-dependent processes in
natural populations; studies on experimental and agricultural plant popula­
tions have recently been reviewed extensively by Harper (76). We focus on
natural plant populations, but many of the concepts developed here are
equally relevant to animal populations, though perhaps harder to apply in
practice.},

@article{lloyd1967crowding,
  abstract = {Patchy distributions matter, from the point of view of the animals involved, because the individuals tend to find more others of their own kind right around them than would be the case in a random distribution. The animals are more 'crowded', in this sense, than their mean density would lead one to believe. For data from randomly placed quadrats, the proposed parameter 'mean crowding' ($\overset \ast \to{m}$) attempts to measure this effect by defining the mean number per individual of other individuals in the same quadrat. 'Mean crowding' is algebraically identical with mean density, augmented by the amount the ratio of variance to mean exceeds unity, i.e. $\overset \ast \to{m}=m+(\sigma ^{2}/m)-1$. It can be viewed as equal to that increased mean density which a patchily distributed population could have, and be no more 'crowded' on the average than it is now, if it had a random distribution. The contention that populations with differing mean densities but the same 'mean crowding' would suffer the same density-dependent effects on mortality, natality, and dispersal implies the untested assumption that the effect of crowding on each individual varies linearly with the number of others around it, which are responsible for the crowding. Also implied is that each local situation (quadrat) is equally good habitat for the animals, has an equal rate of supply of expendable resources, and provides an equal amount of 'room', or cover, which the animals can use to avoid each other. If this assumption is perfectly fulfilled, however, then the patchy distribution itself becomes an ecological enigma: if the effects of crowding are more severe in the locally densest patches, then the local density should decrease more rapidly and increase more slowly there than elsewhere. The overall patchiness should decrease, in fact, until the distribution eventually comes to resemble a random one. Undoubtedly, a great deal of the patchines that one finds in continuous habitats can be explained in terms of local differences in habitat suitability. On the other hand, there is often a large component that appears to be utterly capricious. Since all of the capricious component should long since have been eroded away by density-dependent effects of crowding-if these are important-I must conclude that they are not important in such species, or, if they are, that other population processes (e.g. interactions with other species) regenerate patchiness as rapidly as it is destroyed. This fits in well with a general conviction that patchiness has a great deal more to do with undercrowding than with overcrowding, since 'mean crowding' often appears to be as great in rare species as it is in common ones (of comparable size). A suitable measure of patchiness is the ratio of 'mean crowding' to mean density. Where the distribution can be adequately approximated by the negative binomial, with parameters m and k, we have $\overset \ast \to{m}/m=1+k^{-1}$. The sample estimate for 'mean crowding' is $\overset \ast \to{x}=\overline{x}(1+\hat{k}^{-1})$. Standard errors are given for the cases where k̂ is estimated by maximum likelihood, by moments, by the number of empty quadrats, and also for the truncated negative binomial. The idea is briefly extended to apply to 'mean crowding' between species and to 'subjective' species diversity, without attempting in these cases to develop standard errors. Most importantly, I have tried to specify the types of habitats and distributions to which the parameter 'mean crowding' is not intended to apply.},

  abstract = {Three methods for estimating the average level of gene flow in natural population are discussed and compared. The three methods are FST, rare alleles, and maximum likelihood. All three methods yield estimates of the combination of parameters (the number of migrants [Nm] in a demic model or the neighborhood size [4πDσ2] in a continuum model) that determines the relative importance of gene flow and genetic drift. We review the theory underlying these methods and derive new analytic results for the expectation of FST in stepping-stone and continuum models when small sets of samples are taken. We also compare the effectiveness of the different methods using a variety of simulated data. We found that the FST and rare-alleles methods yield comparable estimates under a wide variety of conditions when the population being sampled is demographically stable. They are roughly equally sensitive to selection and to variation in population structure, and they approach their equilibrium values at approximately the same rate. We found that two different maximum-likelihood methods tend to yield biased estimates when relatively small numbers of locations are sampled but more accurate estimates when larger numbers are sampled. Our conclusion is that, although FST and rare-alleles methods are expected to be equally effective in analyzing ideal data, practical problems in estimating the frequencies of rare alleles in electrophoretic studies suggest that FST is likely to be more useful under realistic conditions.},

Mean crowding allows ecologists to measure the degree of spatial aggregation of individuals in a manner relevant to intraspecific competition for resources. We take the concept of mean crowding a step beyond its most common usage and that it has a mathematical relationship to many of the most important concepts in ecology and evolutionary biology. Mean crowding, a first-order approximation of the degree of nonrandomness in a distribution, can function as a powerful heuristic that can unify concepts across disciplines in a more general way that Lloyd originally envisioned.},

  abstract = { Abstract: A variety of models have shown that spatial dynamics and small‐scale endogenous heterogeneity (e.g., forest gaps or local resource depletion zones) can change the rate and outcome of competition in communities of plants or other sessile organisms. However, the theory appears complicated and hard to connect to real systems. We synthesize results from three different kinds of models: interacting particle systems, moment equations for spatial point processes, and metapopulation or patch models. Studies using all three frameworks agree that spatial dynamics need not enhance coexistence nor slow down dynamics; their effects depend on the underlying competitive interactions in the community. When similar species would coexist in a nonspatial habitat, endogenous spatial structure inhibits coexistence and slows dynamics. When a dominant species disperses poorly and the weaker species has higher fecundity or better dispersal, competition‐colonization trade‐offs enhance coexistence. Even when species have equal dispersal and per‐generation fecundity, spatial successional niches where the weaker and faster‐growing species can rapidly exploit ephemeral local resources can enhance coexistence. When interspecific competition is strong, spatial dynamics reduce founder control at large scales and short dispersal becomes advantageous. We describe a series of empirical tests to detect and distinguish among the suggested scenarios. },

  abstract = {How great an effect does self-generated spatial structure have on logistic population growth? Results are described from an individual-based model (IBM) with spatially localized dispersal and competition, and from a deterministic approximation to the IBM describing the dynamics of the first and second spatial moments. The dynamical system incorporates a novel closure that gives a close approximation to the IBM in the presence of strong spatial structure. Population growth given by the spatial logistic model can differ greatly from that of the nonspatial logistic equation. Numerical simulations show that populations may grow more slowly or more rapidly than would be expected from the nonspatial model, and may reach their maximum rate of increase at densities other than half of the carrying capacity. Populations can achieve asymptotic densities substantially greater than or less than the carrying capacity of the nonspatial logistic model, and can even tend towards extinction. These properties of the spatial logistic model are caused by local dispersal and competition that affect spatial structure, which in turn affects population growth. Accounting for these local spatial processes brings the theory of single-species population growth a step closer to the growth of real spatially structured populations. Corresponding Editor: W. S. C.

  abstract = {Some of the most consistent ecological patterns encountered in nature, such as
species-area relationships and rank-abundance distributions, can be predicted from a class
of neutral models. In this context, neutrality means demographic equivalence between
individuals of all species. Within this class of neutral models, species extinction by
demographic fluctuations is counterbalanced by some speciation mechanism. Each
particular speciation mode leaves an imprint in the resulting patterns. A model with a
mechanistic speciation implementation was shown to generate patterns dependent on
geographic constraints. I used individual based simulations with a mechanistic speciation
implementation to investigate whether the intrinsic spatial patterning of organisms could
transform biodiversity patterns. I found out that there is a phase transition on speciation
modes that is dependent on the spatial structure of the community. An extended range of
the biodiversity patterns found in nature can be unified into a single model because of
this phase transition. Clade richness and age relationships may be understood by the
predicted critical slowdowns in diversification. A new interpretation is given to the post
mass extinction "Dead Clade Walking" effect. An objective and biologically reasonable
redefinition of allopatric speciation is explored by exploiting the phase transition. I
propose the "speciation credit" effect, and its potential implications for long term
biodiversity conservation.},

@article{ralph2019efficiently,
  abstract = {As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates {\textquotedblleft}sample weights{\textquotedblright} within each marginal tree, which are then combined using a {\textquotedblleft}summary function{\textquotedblright}; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in two dual ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated from genome sequence; and by branch, which gives the expected value of the site statistic under the infinite-sites model of mutation. We use the framework to implement many currently-defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics{\textquoteright} relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit) and suggest several new statistics. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},

@article{lundgren2019populations,
  abstract = {Abstract A number of methods commonly used in landscape genetics use an analogy to electrical resistance on a network to describe and fit barriers to movement across the landscape using genetic distance data. These are motivated by a mathematical equivalence between electrical resistance between two nodes of a network and the ‘commute time’, which is the mean time for a random walk on that network to leave one node, visit the other, and return. However, genetic data are more accurately modelled by a different quantity, the coalescence time. Here, we describe the differences between resistance distance and coalescence time, and explore the consequences for inference. We implemented a Bayesian method to infer effective movement rates and population sizes under both these models, and found that inference using commute times could produce misleading results in the presence of biased gene flow. We then used forwards-time simulation with continuous geography to demonstrate that coalescence-based inference remains more accurate than resistance-based methods on realistic data, but difficulties highlight the need for methods that explicitly model continuous, heterogeneous geography.},

@article{jackson2014landscape,
  abstract = {Regional landscape context influences the fate of local populations, yet the spatial extent of this influence (called the “scale of effect”) is difficult to predict. Thus, a major problem for conservation management is to understand the factors governing the scale of effect such that landscape structure surrounding a focal area is measured and managed at the biologically relevant spatial scale. One unresolved question is whether and how scale of effect may depend on the population response measured (e.g., abundance vs. presence/absence). If scales of effect differ across population outcomes of a given species, management based on one outcome may compromise another, further complicating conservation decision making. Here we used an individual-based simulation model to investigate how scales of effect of landscapes that vary in the amount and fragmentation of habitat differ among three population responses (local abundance, presence/absence, and genetic diversity). We also explored how the population response measured affects the relative importance of habitat amount and fragmentation in shaping local populations, and how dispersal distance mediates the magnitude and spatial scale of these effects. We found that the spatial scale most strongly influencing local populations depended on the outcome measured and was predicted to be small for abundance, medium-sized for presence/absence, and large for genetic diversity. Increasing spatial scales likely resulted from increasing temporal scales over which outcomes were regulated (with local genetic diversity being regulated over the largest number of generations). Thus, multiple generations of dispersal and gene flow linked local population patterns to regional population size. The effects of habitat amount dominated the effects of fragmentation for all three outcomes. Increased dispersal distance strongly reduced abundance, but not presence/absence or genetic diversity. Our results suggest that managing protected species at spatial scales based on population abundance data may ignore broader landscape effects on population genetic diversity and persistence, lending support to the importance of managing large buffers surrounding areas of conservation concern.},
